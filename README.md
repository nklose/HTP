# HTP
A CLI-based hacking strategy game/MMO which is deployed on a Linux SSH server. Clients interact through an SSH client. 

# Deployment
1. Install Python 2.x on a Linux server
2. Install an SSH server and allow remote connections
3. Uncomment the lines in .py scripts that disable keyboard shortcuts like Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Z

# Future Work
Once the CLI-only version is functional, it can be deployed for web browsers via a browser-based SSH client, and later via an API and fully-featured website.
